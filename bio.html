	    <td width="178" align="left" valign="top" class="gris2"><span class="principal">Esperanza Collado is a Spanish artist-researcher. Her performance-environments, site-specific works and critical texts investigate the dematerialization of film in art practices, the performativity of writing and the figure of the artist as metahistorian. Often focusing on the phenomenological and situational aspects of cinema and projection, her interdisciplinary works explore the conditions and paradoxes of the performative materiality of the film apparatus at the end of the film age. Recent works revolve around the spatial, sculptural, political, social and choreographic dimensions and potentialities of a cinema by other means. Her book ‘Paracinema: la desmaterialización del cine en las prácticas artísticas’ (Paracinema: the dematerialisation of film in artistic practices), a short version of her Ph.D, won the Spanish Writings on Art Prize from Fundación Arte y Derecho in 2011. She co-founded and manages the editorial project LEVE, which has released 8 records on 45rpm vinyl of site-specific field recordings made by invited artists. Between 2011-17 she was a film programmer of DocuMUSAC, Museum of Contemporary Art of León. She lectures in Cuenca Fine Arts College (UCLM) and in Elías Querejeta Zine Eskola (San Sebastian). In 2020, she's been on a  Fellowship in Taiwan researching expanded cinema in East Asia. Collado's work has been shown in Taipei Contemporary Art Center (Taiwan), Bristol Experimental and Expanded Cinema (UK), Temple Bar Gallery + Studios (Dublin), Images Festival (Toronto), Palais des Beaux Arts (Brussels), MacVal (Paris), Tabakalera CICC (San Sebastian), CA2M (Madrid), Centro de Arte Digital (Mexico), Biennial of Havana (Cuba), Image Forum (Tokyo), Anthology Film Archives (New York), Lajevardi Foundation (Teheran), etc. </span></td>
	    <td width="188" align="left" valign="top" class="gris2"><span class="principal">While living in Dublin (Ireland) between 2004-09, Collado  initiated a series of unprecedented activities related to experimental film and expanded cinema, such as the <a href="https://experimentalfilmclub.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Experimental Film Club,</a> which she co-founded with artist Aoife Desmond*. In 2007 and 2008, and with the support of <a href="https://thisisnotashop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Thisisnotashop</a> (a non-for-profit gallery supported by the Gordon Matta-Clark Estate) she curated the exhibition <em><a href="http://www.donalforeman.com/writing/experimentalspaces.html" target="_blank">'Zero Degree: The New Image of Thought'</a></em> and created '<a href="WRITING/Margenes_08.pdf" target="_blank">Márgenes: Experimento y Praxis'</a>, a monthly showcase for Spanish contemporary experimental film and expanded cinema  in Dublin, which continued the following year in Madrid as 'Márgenes: un conjunto de futuros abandonados' with guest Irish filmmakers such as Vivienne Dick. In 2009 she took on an annual postdoctoral Fellowship from the Spanish Ministry to research body and theatricality issues in exhibition cinema in New York  while producing her first major projector-based performance-environment <em><a href="WORKS/CCC.html">'Cinema…Corpus vs. Cerebrum'</a></em>, recipient of The Art of Film Award by The Arts Council of Ireland. Her bond with Irish film artists remained for years in her various collaborations with <a href="https://maximilianlecain.com/about/" target="_blank">Maximilian Le Cain</a> (Operation Rewrite project, granted in 2011 by Museum of Contemporary Art of Leon) and<a href="http://rouzbehrashidi.com/" target="_blank"> Rouzbeh Rashidi</a>'s <a href="http://www.experimentalfilmsociety.com/" target="_blank">Experimental Film Society</a>. <br>

*Soon after  filmmakers Alan Lampert and Donal Foreman would join. Filmmaker Katie Lincoln also joined very shortly, and academics Daniel Fitzpatrick and Alice Butler, who now run <a href="https://aemi.ie/" target="_blank">AEMI</a>, joined the Experimental Film Club programming committee later in 2011.
