		  <span class="principalnegrita">Esperanza Collado</span><span class="principal"> is an artist and researcher working at the intersection of film, performance, and installation. In general terms, her practice explores the dematerialization of cinema and its articulation beyond the screen, often engaging with ephemeral formats, spatial montage, and the physical presence of the viewer. <br>
<br>
	      Collado's work is informed by her extensive research into expanded cinema and its legacy, and holds a PhD on the concept of paracinema. 
			  <br>
	      <br>
        Her research has been supported by significant international funding, including The Art of Film Award from the Arts Council of Ireland (2009) for her film-performance project Cinema... Corpus vs Cerebrum, a postdoctoral Fellowship in New York (2009-2010) researching the body in exhibition cinema, and a Fellowship in Taiwan (2020) researching expanded cinema in East Asia.<br><br>
			She has presented her work across Europe, the United States, Latin America and Asia, in contexts such as Anthology Film Archives (New York), Light Cone (Paris), Museo Reina Sofía (Madrid), and Image Forum (Tokyo). She is the author of the award-winning book Paracinema: la desmaterialización del cine en las prácticas artísticas (Trama, Madrid 2012) and co-founded the artists' record label LEVE and Experimental Film Club (Dublin).
			<br>
            <br>
            Currently based between Cuenca (Spain) and Taipei (Taiwan), Collado lectures at Cuenca Fine Arts College (UCLM) and directed the MA in Performance Practice and Visual Culture (MNCARS) between 2022—24. She has been a guest lecturer in several art institutions and master's programmes, such as Elías Querejeta Zine Eskola (San Sebastian) and MasterLAV (Madrid).<br>
