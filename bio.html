		 Esperanza Collado is an artist and researcher working at the intersection of film, performance, and installation. Her practice generally explores the dematerialization of cinema and its articulation beyond the screen, often engaging with ephemeral formats, spatial montage, and the physical presence of the viewer. 
<br>
<br>
	      Collado's work is informed by her extensive research into expanded cinema and its legacy, and holds a PhD on the concept of paracinema. 
<br>
<br>
        Her research has been supported by significant international funding, including The Art of Film Award from the Arts Council of Ireland (2009) for her film-performance project <em>Cinema... Corpus vs Cerebrum</em>, a postdoctoral Fellowship in New York (2009-2010) researching the body in exhibition cinema, and a Fellowship in Taiwan (2020) researching expanded cinema in East Asia. <br><br>
