	<td width="180" align="left" valign="top" class= "paginas">A series of four collages that functions as a creative expansion of the film installation <a href="tragame_nube.html">Trágame nube</a>, translating the rhythmic and structural logic of the twin films into a static yet vibrant medium.
<br><br>
Constructed from two pairs of compositions, the series utilizes newspaper clippings and original press documentation of José Val del Omar’s cloud studies. Through a play of colored cardboard cutouts, the collages establish a system of “visibility and hiding.” This formal game mirrors the synchronization of the 16mm loops: while one image is revealed, another is partially obscured, echoing the mechanical opening and closing of the camera shutter. Much like the films, the collages complement each other without being identical. They create a “spatialized archive” that invites the spectator to find resonances between the historical documents of Val del Omar and the contemporary gestures of the installation.</td>
