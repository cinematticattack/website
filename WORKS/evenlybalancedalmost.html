Presented in Monaco, Taipei, Tokyo, Berlin and London, <em>Evenly Balanced, Almost</em> is a textual film that addresses directly and playfully the projected image, the relationship between the film and the audience, and the defining features of the space of projection. The film is complemented by a number of live actions performed by the audience and the projectionists. <br>
<br>
<em>Evenly Balanced, Almost</em> is a site-specific work for the dark theatre in the age of its imminent disappearance.<br>
<br>
			 The work consists of a 16mm film composed entirely of white text on a black background that speaks wittily, and ironically, to the audience. Influenced by Fluxus and the structural wit of Michael Snow’s <em>So Is This</em>, the piece investigates the primary roots of cinema as a medium for words and thoughts. By demanding that the audience “look elsewhere” or “scream,” the work shifts the focus from the screen to the social and physical architecture of the dark theater.

Out of the four pieces presented*, h<em></em>ers perhaps was riskier than any other. A minimal film that played with the idea of cinema’s primary roots as a medium for words and images, where the success of the work was entirely subject to the participation of the audience. There was in this respect a thread of Flux art running through the artist’s gamble. As with Yoko Ono’s <em>Cut Piece</em>, it was down to the audience to choose to pick up the scissors or in this case, rather more playfully turn to look behind or choose to scream. It was a refreshing, witty and intelligent piece of work.”  <br>
