			  <em>Dissipation Essays</em> operates between film sculpture and performative projection, as an optical machine where body, interval, shadow, and repetition converge in a fractured rhythm that suspends and dilates temporal experience. Cinema becomes both object and event, surface and flow, presence and absence. This approach resonates with Iván Zulueta’s explorations of the limits of the cinematic apparatus, while proposing a contemporary way of activating it through its very dissolution.
			  <br>
<br>
<em>Dissipation Essays </em>is a film installation that offers a material and phenomenological reflection on cinema as an ephemeral, spatial and performative medium in dialogue with the work of Iván Zulueta. The starting point is a visual study of the dissipation of the image through the evaporation of clouds, in resonance with Zulueta’s films such as <em>Aquarium</em> (1975) and <em>Leo es Pardo</em> (1976), where temporal perception, atmospheric motion and disappearance are articulated as both formal and poetic strategies.<br><br>
The installation consists of two Super 8mm projectors placed concentrically. The rear projector casts the shadow of the front projector, which in turn projects its image within its own shadow. This setup creates a “mise en abyme” situation where image and shadow are inscribed in the same optical field, producing a visual paradox that explores cinema’s self-reflexivity and dialectical nature. The installation is completed by a rotating disc, functioning both as screen and reflective surface. This element disperses the projected image throughout the exhibition space, suggesting a deflected circulation of light and evoking Zulueta’s observations on the spatial displacement of light.
