		    An activation of the 2-side film installation </span><span class="principalnegrita">Trágame nube</span><span class="principal">, involving 16mm projections, original audio recordings and a fictitious interview with Spanish experimental filmmaker José Val del Omar (1904—1982). <em>The Word Was Deleted</em> was first presented in collaboration with <a href="https://www.davidgarciacasado.net/" target="_blank">David García Casado</a>, who performed live sound, as a closing event of the exhibition <em><a href="https://movingimage.org/event/cinema-of-sensations/" target="_blank">Cinema of Sensations: the Neverending Screen of Val del Omar</a></em> at Museum of the Moving Image in New York.  I have since presented the work as a solo performance, treating and sampling Val del Omar's original audio through analog synthesizers and other sonic devices while delivering live readings of the fictitious interview. <br>
<br>
The interview is printed as a booklet titled <em>I have touched, I don't know with what or when, the Time that is</em> —a phrase drawn from Val del Omar's writings— which is distributed to the audience.<br>
