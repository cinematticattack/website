			<br><br>
			Acúmulo arpegio is an object-based composition conceived for the LEVE exhibition at Centro José Guerrero (Granada). Defined as a "free-style archaeology," the installation seeks to provide a physical and spatial presence to a project that originally inhabits the realms of the intangible and the sonic.
<br><br>
Through a constellation of found and fabricated materials—where the warmth of adobe, esparto, and hazel wood coexists with the coldness of neon and technical cabling—the piece functions as a spatial chord. Each object acts as a note echoing the memory of the artistic residencies, the landscape of Castro de Cepeda (León), and the processes of field recordings, transforming the experience of listening into a tactile and visual presence.
