<em>Things Said Once</em> is an artistic statement and a tribute to film and cinema that acknowledges its history and our responsibility for its continuity in the present. Written as a poem, the text is built around the concept of cinema as experience in its spatial, temporal, and communitarian or social dimensions.As a performance, <em>Things Said Once</em> is presented as a reading in a curated environment that includes a series of performative actions and objects through which the text unfolds.
<br>
<br>«[...] Esperanza Collado’s insightful and generous essay ‘Things Said Once’, a rigorously constructed series of citations drawn in part from her research on paracinematic practices. One of the key figures that emerges here is Hollis Frampton who was the  first  figure to introduce us to the idea of the artist or  filmmaker as ‘metahistorian’, revealing a means by which the history of cinema could be used to act upon itself thereby destabilising the apparent security of our current condition. <br>
	      <br>
        [...]Esperanza’s assemblage mimics those strategies devised by Walter Benjamin for Arcades Project, resulting in a work which gains its meaning through the arrangement of its material.» (Daniel Fitzpatrick and Alice Butler in «Introduction», in Luminous Void: Experimental Film Society Documents, EFS Dublin, Ireland, 2017)
