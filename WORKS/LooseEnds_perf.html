		    Is it possible to imagine a film that is solely the enunciation of its own condition? In 2014, after gathering a series of outtakes and 16mm film footage originally intended for various performances, I began a series of speculative montage exercises under the name<em> Loose Ends / Cabos sueltos</em>. After several attempts to finalize its definitive form, the film was scheduled to be exhibited in an art gallery in 2022, but both the negative and the projection print were lost in transit from the laboratory in Berlin. Through a series of verbal, sonic, and visual declarations, Loose Ends now becomes pure virtuality, a suspended film or one yet to come, activated or 'materialized by the performative dissemination of its constituent elements'*. <br>
		    <br>
		    The work operates as a spectral presence - what remains when the material support disappears. The performance functions as both memorial practice and counter-archive, where absence becomes generative rather than final. By enunciating its own imposibility, <em>Loose Ends</em> questions the boundaries between presence and disappearance, materiality and memory, challenging linear
		    narratives of completion and loss while insisting on dematerialised modes of cinematic existence.<br>
