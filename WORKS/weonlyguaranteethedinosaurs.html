        <span class="principal">From a territory inherited from the confluence of  cinema, sculpture, and dance, the conditions of enunciation of the  filmic image are transformed. Cinema's luminous resonance occupies a  space and has the potentiality of turning it into a tactile, magnetic,  and gaseous geometry from which projecting does not simply consist of  creating optical and magnified images through a film and onto a screen.  To project also relates to thought processes and  bodily actions.*<br>

			«If the performance suggests a pile-up of film history references, it is also informed by a conception of cinema through which all manner of concepts, disciplines, and categories run. Collado’s references to physics, geometry, and optics, and her incorporation of very deliberate, slow, and methodical actions with her props, implies that the “negotiation” of real and illusory film space at the center of We Only Guarantee the Dinosaurs is, in fact, a measurement of different kinds of distances and scales, understood both literally and metaphorically, or both material and ephemeral terms. Collado quotes Dominique Païni’s 2004 essay “Should We Put and End to Projection?”, in which Païni enumerates the word itself, unearthing hidden associations that become the bases for Collado’s essentialist investigation.<br>
<br>
[...] projection, according to Païni, is “a word that refers to activities of thought as much as physical or bodily exertion”, a phrase Collado cites approvingly in a statement accompanying the performance. The notion links Collado’s work to that of Paul Sharits, in its exhaustive cataloguing of “filmic elements”: “processes of intending to make a film; processes of recording light patterns on raw stock [...]; processes of processing; processes of projecting; processes of experiencing.” A film, or a cinematic work, is at the intersection of this nexus of objects, disciplines, thought processes, and energies.» —Jonathan Walley, Cinema Expanded, Oxford Univerity Press, 2020.<br>

			<a href="../WRITING/LFU_7_16_Jodie_Mack.pdf">«We Only Guarantee The Dinosaurs enchanted the audience  with a carefully-constructed choreography guiding a series of objects  through an earnest investigation of the essence of cinema (pre, present,  post) and its possibilities. On/off screen space dissolved; time and  space unfolded in simple gestures; shadow play and dancing leaves, red  ribbons and carpets, friends and muted fruits. The future of a thriving  film art relies upon efforts like [this], so that cinema(rt) never dies  and regenerates into forms we cannot yet know». —Jodie Mack,<em> Love  Letter to Esperanza Collado</em>, in La Furia Umana nº 7 2014. </a><br>

«In a day and age when moving images are so ubiquitous, so easy to  make and handle, and so throwaway, this eccentric process by which she  worked and worked in front of the audience towards a fragile apparition  of a film image affected me as a purification ritual for the moving  image itself, a rebirth, a small and indecisive miracle. Which risks  making the performance sound very pompous - in fact it was very funny as  well and full of healthy absurdity». —Maximilian Le Cain, EFS  Publications 2016.<br>

«Así, el eco de la primera impresión era que estaba ante un espectáculo de variedades, antiguo y divertido, para después cortar con ello despreocupadamente e instalar en mi cabeza la magia del Cine. El sistema del Cine, de la Historia del cine». —Jorge Núñez, Fuerza Vital 2014. </span></td>
