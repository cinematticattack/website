    <td width="226" valign="top" ><span class="principal">Operation Rewrite is a collaborative project by Esperanza Collado and Maximilian Le
    Cain. The project began in January 2011 as an online video work in which both artists posted a number of 45 second moving-image pieces according to a set of rules, most importantly that one-third of the duration of each video should be black screen.
      This <em>peculiarity</em> – the fundamental presence of blank space as an act of expropriation, displacement and projection - became the main subject of our working process, which quickly boiled over into a series of works in and outside of the moving-image medium. Operation Rewrite was designed to grow from its online embryo, identifying, expanding into and occupying other places.<br />
      <br />
Our work deals with the workings of the cut, suspension and interruption as fundamental associative principles of cinema and (both its) consecutive (and preceding) matters.<br />
<br />
The concept of cinema we examine is subject to constant reassessment, embracing perception and projection technology as much as the articulation of signs; the human body as technological contraptions, domestic items as much as film materiality.<br />
<br />
As the project develops, certain objects, images and actions recur, acquiring resonance and significance, as they are re-used. Operation Rewrite occupies a zone between dream, cinema and mundane ritual.</span><span class="obras"><br />

    <td width="224" valign="top" class="once"><span class="principal">Operation Rewrite performances usually involve the artists, as ‘scientist’ figures, interacting with elaborate film projections (Super8 and 16mm), pre-recorded and
      live sounds, as well as objects arranged to form mutant installations. Cut-up film noir narratives may coexist with a materialist investigation of both the artist’s body and
      the body of cinema. The latter is considered from an ‘amplique’ or expanded view after the achievements of Lettrism. The medium
    of film becomes an object, malleable and fragile, edible, destructible, and capable of measuring space and time. Projected light and its magnetic field of intermittency may bleed through a sewing machine illuminated against a corporeal screen and penetrate a blindfold. <br />
    <br />
    All of these actions and others, framed by a series of subtle and straightforward interruptions, make Operation Rewrite performances disturbing and humorous
      in equal parts. They typically feature such objects and events as 16mm and Super8
      film projections, darkroom compositions, choreographed actions, diegetic sounds,
      tape recordings, feathers, eggs, tools, an oval mirror, a gas mask, fake blood, a pipe, a brown folder, a filmstrip, buckets of liquid, an empty cloak, an ironing board, shoulder massage,
      a spooky television, a bloody X, a variety of other Xs, red light, a phone conversation,
    a cocktail shaker, a sewing machine, light bleed, palm trees, tennis equipment, robot costumes, printed letters... A few of our performances featured Irish theatre writer, director and performer John McCarthy, a lead performer in many of Le Cain’s films.    </span></td>
